    "# Tasks Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Understanding & Insights\n",
    "    - Load and explore the dataset using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find missing values, data types, and unique categories.\n",
    "- Visualize key relationships:\n",
    "     - Attrition vs. Age\n",
    "     - Attrition vs. MonthlyIncome\n",
    "     - Attrition vs. Department\n",
    "     - Correlation heatmap for numerical features.\n",
    "- Write 3‚Äì5 key insights from your observations (e.g., ‚ÄúYounger employees tend to leave more frequently.‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing (Pipeline Implementation)\n",
    "Split the dataset into train and test sets (80:20).\n",
    "Use a ColumnTransformer and Pipeline to perform:\n",
    "- Numerical preprocessing: SimpleImputer(strategy='mean') + StandardScaler\n",
    "- Categorical preprocessing: SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent') + OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')\n",
    "- Combine preprocessing and model into a single pipeline for each model type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Implementation\n",
    "Train and evaluate the following models using the preprocessed data:\n",
    "- Linear Regression (for predicting MonthlyIncome as an additional regression subtask)\n",
    "- Logistic Regression (for Attrition classification)\n",
    "- Regularized Linear Models:\n",
    "    - Ridge\n",
    "    - LASSO\n",
    "    - Elastic Net\n",
    "    - Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "- Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters such as:\n",
    "    - Ridge/LASSO alpha values\n",
    "    - ElasticNet l1_ratio\n",
    "    - DecisionTree depth and min_samples_split\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation\n",
    "Use appropriate metrics:\n",
    "- For regression: RMSE, R¬≤ Score\n",
    "- For classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC\n",
    "- Create a comparison dataframe summarizing all models‚Äô performances.\n",
    "    - Plot ROC curves for classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Insights & Interpretation\n",
    "- Identify which model performs best and why.\n",
    "- Discuss which features most strongly influence Attrition (use .coef_ or feature_importances_).\n",
    "- Write a short business interpretation of the findings:\n",
    "    - ‚ÄúEmployees with low satisfaction and longer overtime hours are more likely to leave.‚Äù\n",
    "    - ‚ÄúElastic Net performed best with balanced bias-variance trade-off.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Stretch Goal (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Pipeline + GridSearchCV end-to-end automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform feature selection using model coefficients or recursive elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize Decision Tree structure using plot_tree()."
